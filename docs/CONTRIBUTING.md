# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `AhaEvent` for local development.
You can contribute in many ways:

1. Fork the `AhaEvent` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

  ```shell
  $ git clone git@github.com:your_username_here/AhaEvent.git
  ```

3. Install packages

  ```shell
  $ cd AhaEvent/
  $ npm install && cd functions && npm install && cd ../
  $ npm install -g gulp-cli firebase-tools
  $ npm run build
  $ firebase serve
  ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

  ```shell
  $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
  ```
   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the test.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

  ```shell
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
  $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
  ```

7. Submit a pull request through the [GitHub website](https://github.com/forksociety/AhaEvent).

## How to contribute?
* Follow the Getting Started guidelines to get a headstart.
* Create an issue first and then get it approved before creating a PR to allow for better management.
* Make sure to make PRs against the `dev` branch.
* No trivial edits, ie. simply rearranging topics will not be accepted.

## Types of Contributions

You can contribute in many ways:

### Submitting A FLOSS Event

If you find any new FLOSS conference coming up which matches with [our criteria](FAQ.md#what-type-of-events-can-be-showcased-on-ahaeventorg), please create a JSON file in `functions/events/` and submit a PR. Please make sure that the JSON file follows the [JSON schema](EVENT_JSON_SCHEMA.md).

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/forksociety/AhaEvent/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/forksociety/AhaEvent/issues) for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

AhaEvent could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official AhaEvent docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/forksociety/AhaEvent/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.md.
